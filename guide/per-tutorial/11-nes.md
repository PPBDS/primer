### 11 — NES  *(Position 7, Medium predictive)*

- **Type:** example
- **"Imagine":** You are a political scientist studying the 1992 presidential election, curious whether men and women differed in their support for Clinton, Bush, and Perot. There are many decisions to make.
- **Dataset:** NES (`primer.data`), 1992 presidential election
- **Outcome:** `pres_vote` — vote choice (Clinton / Bush / Perot)
- **Treatment / Key covariate:** `sex` (Male/Female)
- **Question (QoI):** What was the difference in voting preference of men and women in the 1992 US Presidential election?
- **Model:** Multinomial logistic regression
- **Causal / Predictive:** Predictive
- **Student project:** `nes`
- **Data prep:** `nes |> filter(year == 1992) |> select(sex, pres_vote) |> drop_na() |> mutate(pres_vote = as.factor(case_when(pres_vote == "Democrat" ~ "Clinton", pres_vote == "Republican" ~ "Bush", pres_vote == "Third Party" ~ "Perot")))` → `nes_92`
- **Final model:** `multinom_reg(engine = "nnet") |> fit(pres_vote ~ sex, data = nes_92)` → `fit_nes`
- **Preceptor Table:** Unit (Voter) | Outcome (Vote) | Covariate (Sex)
- **Population Table:** Source | Unit/Time (Voter, Year) | Outcome (Vote) | Covariate (Sex)
